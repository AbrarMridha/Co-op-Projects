# Welcome to My Project Portfolio!👋🏼
<p>Hello and welcome to my GitHub repository! 🎉 This directory showcases the projects I've
worked on to build my skills in <b>data analysis</b> and <b>software development</b>. These projects 
represent my dedication to learning and applying practical techniques that I will bring to my future co-op role.
<br><br>
As I prepare to apply for a co-op term, I’m excited to share my work with you. Feel free to explore the code, review the documentation, and see how I’ve applied my skills. If you have any questions or feedback, I’d love to hear from you!
<br><br>
Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find my projects insightful!
<br><br>
Happy coding!<br>
